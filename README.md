# Meeting-Scheduler

## Schedule your meetings and sit back and relax

### So I have been wondering if any magic could open my "Online" meetings so I wouldn't be late sitting and waiting for the page to load on top of me being late hence making me even more late to the meetings, and hence came this new app (very first release v1.0.0) Meeting Scheduler, working perfectly fine during testing and has been opening my meetings on the time specified, well you are here sitting and reading my boring story that I typed and still reading it, now stop reading and click this link (Meeting Scheduler)[https://github.com/Nigelrex/Meeting-Scheduler/releases/tag/v1.0.0] and get it downloaded, I said stop reading omg you are still reading this, i should stop :welp:

# ChangeLog
